# Building-a-Hack-Computer
In this project we build a Computer along with an assembler from using nand gates.

In the project one , basic logic gates are built only by using NAND gates.

In the project two , We build Basic Adder circuits and ALU(Arithmetic Logic Unit).

In the project three , We complete the memory storage architecture from a bit register to ram 16k.

In the project four, We add input and ouptut devices to the cpu.

In the project five, We build a CPU and use the memory we defined early and complete the mission of building a hack compter.

In the end we build an ASSEMBLER which helps convert the ASM code to Machine Language.
